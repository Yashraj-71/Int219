            <h2>Aryabhatta</h2>
            <p>Aryabhata (born 476, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura, India) was an astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician
                whose work and history are available to modern scholars. He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to
                distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura—near Patalipurta
                (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta dynasty—where he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c. 499) and the now 
                lost Aryabhatasiddhanta. Aryabhatasiddhanta circulated mainly in the northwest of India and, through the Sāsānian dynasty
                (224–651) of Iran, had a profound influence on the development of Islamic astronomy. Its contents are preserved to some 
                extent in the works of Varahamihira (flourished c. 550), Bhaskara I (flourished c. 629), Brahmagupta (598–c. 665), and 
                others. It is one of the earliest astronomical works to assign the start of each day to midnight.</p>
